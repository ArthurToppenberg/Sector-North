# Game app rules for Claude (`sector-north-game`)

These are the working conventions for the Phaser app in this directory. The project-wide
rules (GPS is the source of truth, fail fast, pnpm only, HUD white/black only) live in
the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` and apply here in full.

## Boot sequence

`index.html` provides fixed build-time markup — a `#game` mount and a `#loader` boot
overlay. `src/main.ts` assumes both exist: it resolves them via `requireElement()` and
throws immediately if either is missing, rather than treating a missing DOM node as a
runtime/degraded state. Before the Phaser game is even created, boot first
`await loadHudFont()`s — loading the self-hosted @fontsource Chakra Petch weights
(400/600, declared once in `HUD_FONT_WEIGHTS`) and throwing loudly if any weight never
resolves, because Phaser rasterises text onto a canvas and a missing face would silently
fall back to the wrong typeface. A boot failure is surfaced into the mount's `textContent`
and then re-thrown, rather than left as a silent black screen. The loader teardown is
registered as a listener for `APP_READY_EVENT` *before* Phaser's async `create()` can run,
and is only torn down once that event fires (world projected; toolbar + city SVG glyphs,
city + radar photos, and world-data JSON all loaded) — never on a timer or guess.

## Module layout — keep the boundary

- `src/map/` — **world data + projection.** Pure TypeScript, no Phaser imports.
  - `geojson.ts` / `cities.ts` / `airports.ts` / `radars.ts` — load and strictly validate the
    bundled data (throw on any structural surprise; the data is a fixed build-time
    asset, so anything unexpected is a bug we want to see immediately). Validation is
    not just structural: every lon/lat is range-checked against WGS84 bounds
    (lon −180..180, lat −90..90) and rejected if non-finite, so a swapped or corrupt
    coordinate fails fast at load rather than projecting to a wrong pixel.
  - `validate.ts` — the shared strict-validation vocabulary those four loaders compose
    (`makeFail`, `requireLon`/`requireLat`, `requireNonEmptyString`, `requireOneOf`, …).
    The WGS84 bounds live here **once**; a loader must never restate them. Helpers take
    the caller's `fail` so messages keep their per-module `[map/<x>]` tag, and the caller
    composes the subject text. Must stay Phaser- and config-free like the rest of
    `src/map/`. (`src/game/fail.ts` is a deliberate 3-line twin of `makeFail` for the
    render side, rather than coupling `game/` error plumbing into the world layer.)
  - `project.ts` — the projection layer (see below).
- `src/game/` — **Phaser rendering + input.** Consumes projected output; never parses
  GeoJSON or re-derives the projection. Within it, keep the small pure-helper modules
  separate so each has one reason to change: `math.ts` (generic, domain-agnostic math —
  no Phaser/projection/game knowledge), `units.ts` (screen↔world pixel scaling), and
  `camera.ts` (camera → world-view geometry). `radarImages.ts` and `cityImages.ts` hold the
  name → photo-asset join for radars and cities respectively — the seam between world data
  and the bundled photos. Keeping them here deliberately leaves `src/map/radars.ts` and
  `src/map/cities.ts` pure world data with no asset URLs. Both maps are allowed to be partial:
  `radarImageAsset`/`cityImageAsset` return `null` rather than throwing for an entry with no
  photo — a genuinely image-less case, not a missing asset; keep that fail-fast-exception
  note inline. (The radar map is partial today — only some sites have a licensed photo; every
  current city has one, but the same null contract still holds for a future photo-less city.)
- `src/data/` — bundled data assets. Coordinates are lon/lat (WGS84); prefer simplified
  geometry (fewer points = faster to draw). Every dataset is imported the same way — via
  Vite `?url`, so each file is emitted to `dist/` and fetched at runtime (through Phaser's
  loader into the JSON cache) rather than inlined into the JS bundle. `MainScene.preload()`
  requests each URL; the `src/map/` loaders validate the parsed JSON handed to them in
  `create()`. To keep the small datasets (`major-cities.json` ~0.6 KB, `radars.json`
  ~2.6 KB) from being inlined as base64 data URIs under Vite's default 4 KB threshold,
  `vite.config.ts` sets `assetsInlineLimit` to force all `.json` assets to emit as files.
  - Country boundaries — `borders/*.json` (currently belgium, czechia, denmark, france,
    germany, latvia, lithuania, netherlands, norway, poland, russia, slovakia, sweden,
    united-kingdom); `geojson.ts` exposes them as `BOUNDARY_ASSETS` and validates each.
  - `major-cities.json`, `airports.json` and `radars.json` — each exposes a
    `*_ASSET` ({ cacheKey, url }) from `cities.ts` / `airports.ts` / `radars.ts`, which
    also parse and validate the fetched JSON.
    - A city record carries **researched flavour metadata** (`region`, `founded`, `notes`)
      alongside its `population`. These are surfaced in the city detail/info window that
      opens on click (with the city's landmark photo from `cityImages.ts`); kept strictly
      validated and in sync with `major-cities.json`. `founded` is free text (a year or a
      century, e.g. `"1868"` / `"11th century"`) since Danish cities' origins are dated at
      very different precisions.
    - An airport's `tier` (`major` / `minor` / `military`) is a coarse importance tier
      **carried directly as a field on each entry in the bundled `airports.json`**; the
      render layer reads it to decide what shows at which zoom (majors + airbases always,
      minor strips only once zoomed in — see the reveal-zoom rule under rendering).
    - A radar record also carries **researched flavour/spec metadata** (`manufacturer`,
      `origin`, `type`, `dimensionality`, `band`, `altitudeCeilingKm`, `notes`). These are
      now surfaced in the radar detail/info window that opens on click; they are kept
      strictly validated and in sync with `radars.json`. The `dimensionality`/`band`/
      altitude values are still reserved for the future 2D-vs-3D altitude / band-based
      gameplay mechanics discussed for later. `altitudeCeilingKm` is `null` for a 2D
      sensor: an honest "not applicable", never a masked missing value.

Co-located sites are **never collapsed** — no marker is merged away or moved to a
midpoint. `loadAirports()` just parses and validates; every airfield keeps its own glyph
(a military airbase and its co-located civil airport stay two triangles; a radar on the
same base stays its own circle). Only their *labels* are combined, so the map still shows
each physical thing while decluttering overlapping text.

`colocate.ts` holds that shared, type-agnostic co-location logic, split into two steps:
`clusterByProximity` groups *any* POIs within `COLOCATION_RADIUS_KM` (single-linkage,
computed once), and `resolveColocationLabels` turns those clusters into one label per
item **given which items are currently visible**. Within a cluster only the shown members
count: the lowest-`priority` visible one owns the label and shows its name with a `" +N"`
badge for the rest (its glyph and theirs still draw); everyone else is suppressed. So
toggling a layer off drops both its glyph and its share of the `+N`, and can hand
ownership to a lower-priority site still shown. `MainScene` supplies the ranking (military
airfield < major < minor < radar, so a base's own name beats the radar on it), holds the
live per-layer visibility flags, and re-runs `resolveColocationLabels` → `layer.setLabels`
on every airport/radar toggle. The radius is a **real-world km distance**, so it lives in
`colocate.ts` (the world layer, in km) — not in `config.ts`, which holds only on-screen
pixel constants. This is the "GPS is the source of truth" rule applied to a data transform:
proximity is judged in real geographic distance, never pixels. The `COLOCATION_RADIUS_KM`
value (6 km) is calibrated empirically: it merges the airfield + radar + civil airport that
share a single Danish air base, yet keeps genuinely separate sites apart (e.g. the Bornholm
radar ~10 km from Bornholm airport stays its own site).

New code must respect this split: geographic reasoning goes in `src/map/`, drawing and
input go in `src/game/`.

## Testing (vitest)

`pnpm --filter sector-north-game test` runs the vitest suite (`test:watch` for watch
mode). Tests are colocated as `src/**/*.test.ts` — inside tsconfig's `include`, so
`typecheck` covers them; `vite build` never sees them (nothing imports a test).

- `vitest.config.ts` is **standalone on purpose** — `vite.config.ts` carries build-only
  plugins (bundle-size report, JSON minification) that must not run under the test
  runner. Being a Vite config, it still resolves the `?url` asset imports in `src/map/`.
- Environment is plain `node` — the pure `src/map/` modules and the loaders need no DOM.
  The one exception: `src/game/config.ts` reads `window.devicePixelRatio` at module
  load, so any test touching a config-importing module (`units.test.ts`) must stub
  `globalThis.window` **before a dynamic `import()`** of the module under test — a
  static import would hoist above the stub and crash. Do not add jsdom for this.
- What is covered: the projection (including the fit-pinning/locked-zoom invariant),
  the aircraft sim, co-location clustering + label ownership, every data loader (each
  also parses its real bundled dataset — geojson uses belgium, the smallest boundary,
  because tsc cannot reasonably type a multi-MB JSON module), and the pure `game/`
  helpers (`units`, `math`). Phaser layers/scenes are deliberately untested — verifying
  them means running the game, which is the user's job (see root CLAUDE.md).
- Tests assert error *substrings* (e.g. `/out-of-range longitude/`), not full messages,
  so validator refactors that keep semantics don't churn the suite.

- `src/log/` — **pure, framework-free logging.** `logger.ts` is a process-wide `Logger`
  singleton with no Phaser/rendering knowledge; any module can call `log.info(...)` etc.
  without threading an instance through. It holds a bounded newest-500 ring of entries
  (`MAX_ENTRIES = 500`) — older lines are deliberately dropped once a session runs long,
  rather than growing unbounded — broadcasts them via `subscribe`/`snapshot`, throws on an
  empty message, and mirrors every entry to the matching browser-console method
  (`CONSOLE_METHOD`) as a deliberate second sink, not a fallback: both are meant to show
  the line, so lines show both in the in-game console and devtools. It knows nothing about
  how entries are drawn. `src/game/ConsoleWindow.ts` is the sole *in-game* consumer and owns
  all timestamp/level formatting; each line is coloured by level (see the console bullet
  below). The four levels exist, but **`debug` has no callers** — the routine per-event
  chatter was removed rather than filtered, so a `debug` call reappearing is a deliberate
  choice, not leftover noise. Reserve `info` for one-time lifecycle milestones (boot steps,
  world-data loaded, scene ready), `warn`/`error` for genuine problems.
- `src/commands/` — **pure, framework-free command registry.** `registry.ts` is a
  framework-free seam any part of the project can import to expose a slash-command in the
  developer console, without knowing about Phaser or console rendering: it exports a
  `Command` interface and a process-wide `commands` singleton any module can import to
  `register(...)` a slash-command, plus `parseCommandLine`. The console parses input, looks
  it up, and runs it. A command needing game state (audio, a scene, layers) is registered
  from `src/game/` and captures what it needs by closure at registration — that is why the
  registry module itself stays pure/framework-free while the game-touching commands live
  grouped in `src/game/sceneCommands.ts` (`/subwoofer`, `/spawn-planes`, `/clear-planes`),
  which `MainScene.create()` calls once with the live scene objects.
  `/help` ships with the registry (it just lists the live command set). `ConsoleWindow`'s
  input row is the one caller that dispatches typed lines through it. Duplicate/invalid
  names throw at registration (fail fast) rather than silently shadowing.

## The projection layer (`src/map/project.ts`)

The heart of the "GPS is the source of truth" design — the **only** place that knows how
lon/lat becomes pixels.

- **The fit is pinned to a fixed frame, not to whatever is loaded.** `projectToPixels`
  takes an optional third `fitGeometry` argument; the scale, origin, `pixelsPerKm`, and
  therefore the projected camera bounds are computed from *that* set only, while all of
  `geometry` is drawn through the resulting projector. `MainScene` passes
  `PROJECTION_FRAME_ASSETS` (the original Denmark-centred six: denmark, germany,
  netherlands, norway, poland, sweden) as the frame. **This is load-bearing for the locked
  zoom:** the map's scale and the projected `CAMERA_CENTER_BOUNDS` depend on the fit, so
  adding a country to `BOUNDARY_ASSETS` for context (belgium, france, the Baltics, russia,
  etc.) draws it *without* rescaling the map or changing the zoom. Never fold context
  boundaries into the frame, and never fit to the full geometry — either silently changes
  the zoom, which is a locked setting (see the camera-bounds rule below).
- `projectToPixels(geometry, viewport, fitGeometry?)` fits `fitGeometry` (default:
  `geometry`) to the viewport **once** and returns:
  - `project(lon, lat)` — the single lon/lat → pixel transform. Every overlay (city
    markers, future aircraft, anything placed on the map) must route through this
    function rather than re-deriving the fit.
  - `pixelsPerKm` — valid on both axes thanks to the latitude correction. Use it to
    express real distances (grid cells, ranges, speeds) in the render; never invent a
    separate pixels-per-km factor.
  - `bounds` — the drawn geometry's pixel bounding box; its top-left corner
    (`x`/`y`) anchors the grid origin. (Camera bounds are separate: projected from
    `CAMERA_CENTER_BOUNDS` via `project()`, not derived from this box.)
  - `polygons` — the projected geometry as one flat `Float32Array` per ring (interleaved
    `[x0, y0, x1, y1, …]` device pixels), chosen to be compact and cache-friendly for the
    drawing layer to iterate.
- The projection is equirectangular with a `cos(meanLatitude)` longitude correction —
  cheap and accurate enough for a country-scale map. If/when exact real-speed simulation
  demands more accuracy, the sanctioned upgrade is projecting through **UTM zone 32N
  (EPSG:25832)** (the standard Danish grid, yields meters directly) via `proj4` — done
  *inside this module*, so nothing else changes.

## Rendering & scene conventions

- **Project once; the camera owns pan/zoom.** The world is projected a single time at
  scene creation. All subsequent zoom/pan goes through the Phaser camera
  (`CameraController`) — never re-project the world model in response to camera moves.
- **`MainScene` is a composition root only.** It loads/projects the world, wires up the
  layers, camera controller, and HUD, and forwards signals (update tick, resize, zoom
  change). Rendering and input logic belong in the layer/controller classes, not in the
  scene — and the scene's *pure* per-entity glue lives in three sibling modules it
  composes rather than inlines:
  - `markerBuilders.ts` — record → marker mappers (city/airport/radar/sweep) plus the
    colocation priority constants and `buildColocationInputs`. Type-only imports, no
    runtime Phaser, so it is node-tested like the `src/map/` modules it joins. Airports
    then radars is the load-bearing ordering every colocation consumer slices at
    `airports.length`.
  - `windowContent.ts` — record → `InfoWindowContent` builders, beside
    `cityImages.ts`/`radarImages.ts` (their sole content consumers).
  - `sceneCommands.ts` — `registerSceneCommands({ sim, planeLayer, subwoofer })`, the
    game-state console commands captured by closure; called exactly once from
    `create()` (the registry throws on duplicates).
  What must stay in the scene: layer construction, the live `airportsVisible`/
  `radarsVisible` closures the toolbar toggles capture, camera wiring, the update/resize
  ticks, and the console open/close funnel.
- **Three reaction patterns for layers — pick the right one:**
  - *Zoom-reactive* (coastline stroke width, city / airport / radar marker/label sizing):
    refreshed via the camera controller's `onZoomChanged` fan-out in `MainScene`. New
    zoom-reactive layers are added to that one callback, not wired at individual call sites.
    Every such layer's constructor also calls its own `onZoomChanged(currentZoom)` once,
    immediately after creating its game objects (AirportLayer, CityLayer, CoastlineLayer,
    RadarLayer all follow this identical constructor-call pattern) — so the layer is fully
    and correctly rendered before any input or camera event fires, rather than left to a
    separate first-draw step the caller must remember. The rationale now lives here rather
    than being duplicated inline in each layer. **That self-call must stay in each leaf
    constructor** — never lift it into a shared base class, whose constructor would run it
    before the subclass's fields initialize (`useDefineForClassFields`). Each layer also
    validates the camera zoom is finite and strictly positive before deriving any on-screen
    size via `screenPxToWorld`, through the shared `assertZoom` in `layerHelpers.ts` —
    throwing rather than silently producing Infinite/NaN geometry from a zero/NaN/negative
    zoom. `layerHelpers.ts` is the home for all such cross-layer marker plumbing:
    `assertMarkers` (shared skeleton + a `perMarker` callback for each layer's extra
    fields), `createHitZone`/`setHitZonesInteractive`/`sizeHitZones` (the click-vs-drag
    hit-target machinery City and Radar share), and `createMarkerLabel` (the
    `resolution: DPR` + bottom-centre-anchor label idiom). It is deliberately a module of
    free functions + interfaces, **not** a POI base class: CityLayer is Image-array-based
    while Airport/Radar are single-Graphics-based, so a base would leak one design into
    the other.
  - *Viewport-reactive* (grid slice, HUD readout): runs in `update`, guarded by the
    camera-moved dirty check so idle frames do no work. Remember that a window resize
    changes the viewport without moving the camera — handle it in `onResize`.
  - *Every-frame / animated* (`RadarSweepLayer`): redraws every frame *while visible* off the
    scene's `update` tick — gated only by its own visibility (the radar toolbar toggle), not by
    the camera-moved dirty check — because its content is intrinsically time-varying. This
    is cheap here only because there are a handful of sites; reach for it just for genuinely
    animated content, not to dodge the dirty-check discipline above. Because all its geometry
    is world-space (km → pixels via `pixelsPerKm`), a sweep covers the same patch of ground at
    every zoom, so — unlike the static marker layers — it needs no zoom handler / `onZoomChanged`
    wiring: only the stroke widths are re-derived per frame (via `screenPxToWorld`) to hold a
    constant on-screen thickness. **Clutter reduction:** every site's sweep angle still advances
    every frame while visible, but only a single site actually draws its range ring and sweep
    hand each frame — the rest advance silently off-screen. The drawn site is coverage-first
    (`RadarSweepLayer.selectSweepIndex`): a radar whose range ring *contains* the view centre
    beats one that doesn't (so a nearer but smaller-range radar loses to a farther radar you're
    actually inside), and the physically nearest breaks ties within a containment tier; if the
    centre is inside no ring, the nearest overall is drawn so a sweep always shows. Angles are
    never reset when a site gains or loses the "drawn" status, so whichever site becomes the
    drawn one is already at its correct, continuous phase rather than snapping to zero; the
    starting angles are staggered at construction (one full turn spread evenly across the sites)
    for the same reason on the very first frame.
- **Two cameras:** the main camera draws only world layers; a fixed UI camera (zoom 1, no
  scroll) draws only the HUD, so HUD elements keep a constant on-screen size. Each camera
  `ignore()`s the other's objects. Register any new object with the correct camera.
  **The `objects` getter is the routing seam for this:** every world render layer (GridLayer,
  CoastlineLayer, CityLayer, AirportLayer, RadarLayer, RadarSweepLayer, PlaneLayer) exposes a
  bare `objects` getter enumerating every Phaser GameObject it owns, so `MainScene`/`setupCameras`
  can hand that layer's objects to the correct camera (e.g. tell the fixed UI camera to
  `ignore()` the world layers). The seam is a real interface — `WorldLayer` in
  `layerHelpers.ts`, with `ZoomReactive`/`ToggleableLayer` for the zoom-fan-out and
  toolbar-toggle families — which every world layer `implements`. One-off HUD/overlay components that must stay a constant
  on-screen size (not pan/zoom with the world) — e.g. the `/subwoofer` easter egg
  (`src/game/subwoofer.ts`) — opt into the fixed UI camera the same way: expose an `objects`
  getter that `MainScene` routes there. This is the documented pattern for any future one-off
  overlay (photo flashes, popups, etc.) to join the fixed UI camera, not just the world layers.
- **Detail/info windows are per-location HUD panels on the UI camera.** At most one window
  exists per location; clicking a location *toggles* it (open a fresh one, or close the
  existing one). New windows cascade so they don't stack exactly on top of each other, and
  a click or drag raises a window to front; its close button disposes it. Each window is
  its own draggable instance that owns its position and lives on the fixed UI camera, so it
  keeps a constant on-screen size like the rest of the HUD. Because windows are created
  *after* `setupCameras` runs, `InfoWindowManager` must route each new window's objects to
  the UI camera itself and have the world camera `ignore()` them — a HUD object otherwise
  renders on every camera. This is a concrete instance of the two-camera rule above.
  Window content (`InfoWindowContent`) is **entity-agnostic**: a record maps into the same
  title / fields / optional-image shape, so the window component never learns about entity
  types. The city (`cityWindowContent`) and radar (`radarWindowContent`) builders are wired
  — clicking a city or radar marker toggles its window; airfields are not yet clickable. Each
  layer owns one invisible interactive hit `Zone` per marker (held at a constant on-screen
  size, disabled when the layer is hidden) that distinguishes a click from a drag by pointer
  travel, so a camera pan ending over a marker never opens a window. The entity-agnostic
  shape is what lets each new type get its own content builder without editing the window.
- **The developer console (`ConsoleWindow`) is a draggable HUD panel** on the fixed UI
  camera (constant on-screen size). The toolbar's developer button toggles it; the "/"
  (forward-slash) key *opens* it (once open, "/" is a command prefix the input row captures,
  so it must not toggle shut — close with the × button, the toolbar glyph, or Escape). The
  open/close paths funnel through `MainScene.setConsoleOpen()` so the window, the toolbar
  glyph, and the key never drift; it starts closed. It renders the shared `src/log/logger.ts`
  buffer as a scrollable text log, docked bottom-left when opened. **Log lines are coloured
  by level** (`CONSOLE.levelColors`) — the sanctioned exception to the white/black/green HUD
  rule (see root CLAUDE.md), because the console is a debugging tool, not tactical chrome.
  - **Clipping + colour via a fixed Text pool.** There is one `Text` object *per visible
    viewport row* (the pool is sized once from the fixed panel height — the panel never
    resizes, only its origin moves on drag), each carrying its own colour, since a single
    `Text` is one colour. Clipping is by content, not a mask or crop: each pooled row only
    holds the one wrapped line currently at its slot, because Phaser `crop` lands in the wrong
    space for a DPR-scaled Text texture and geometry masks were unreliable across the
    two-camera setup — both were tried and rejected. An off-screen `measure` Text does the
    per-entry word-wrap. **The pool must be created before `setupCameras`** — a Text made
    afterwards renders on both cameras.
  - Scroll position is an offset into the wrapped lines with a draggable scrollbar reflecting
    it; the view auto-follows the newest line until the user scrolls up, then holds until they
    return to the bottom.
  - **A command input row** is pinned below the log (prompt + typed text + blinking caret).
    While the console is open it captures keystrokes (`ANY_KEY_DOWN`) and `MainScene` suspends
    the camera's keyboard pan (`CameraController.setKeyboardPanEnabled`) so typing a command
    doesn't also drive the map. Enter dispatches the line through the `src/commands/` registry
    (echoed as `> …`, then the command's output logged, or a `warn` for an unknown name);
    Backspace edits, Escape closes. The registry is the seam — see the `src/commands/` bullet.
- **Constant on-screen sizes** (hairline strokes, marker dots, pan speed) are computed
  with `screenPxToWorld(screenPx, zoom)` from `src/game/units.ts` — the single source of
  truth for the screen↔world scaling trick. Don't hand-roll `x * DPR / zoom`.
- **Draw order lives in `DEPTH` in `src/game/config.ts`.** Add new layers there; no
  scattered magic `setDepth` numbers.
- **Marker glyph language — distinguish by shape / size / fill, never colour** (the HUD
  white/black rule): cities draw as the Lucide `building-2` icon (the same glyph the
  toolbar's cities toggle shows, so a control and the thing it toggles read as one); airfields
  draw as triangles, with importance encoded by glyph *size* (major airports + military
  airbases large, minor fields small) and branch by *fill* (military solid, civil hollow);
  radars draw as a hollow circle. Every glyph is drawn while its layer is on — only the
  *names* reveal progressively by zoom: airfield majors/military at `AIRPORT.labelRevealZoom`,
  minor fields at the closer `AIRPORT.minorLabelRevealZoom`, and the (sparse) radars at a
  lower zoom than the airports. Radar coverage is drawn by the separate `RadarSweepLayer`
  (its own `DEPTH.radarSweep`, toggled together with the radar markers): a faint world-space
  range ring plus an animated rotating sweep hand, sized by the site's real `rangeKm` — the
  one HUD element in phosphor green (`MAP.strokeColor`), the sanctioned colour exception (see
  the root `CLAUDE.md` HUD rule and `RADAR.sweep`). Only one site draws its coverage each frame
  — see the coverage-first selection rule in the "Every-frame / animated" bullet above.
- **The coastline is drawn as world-space vectors, not a baked texture** — so the outline
  stays a crisp hairline at any zoom and the camera transform makes pan/zoom free (no
  per-frame re-tessellation). Its world-space line width is recompensated on zoom to hold a
  constant on-screen thickness.
- **The reference grid is a GPS-derived scale bar.** Because each cell is a fixed real-world
  size (`GRID.cellKm` × `pixelsPerKm`), cells stay square and constant on the ground, giving
  the player a readable scale even out over open water where no land is in view.
- **HUD controls are decoupled from what they control.** Each toolbar button owns its own
  on/off state and reports changes through the `onToggle` callback the scene supplies — it
  never reaches into the layers directly; `MainScene` owns that wiring.
- **HUD icons are SVGs baked into textures (`src/game/svgIcon.ts`).** HUD glyphs come from
  Lucide SVGs, authored with `currentColor`. A standalone SVG rasterised into a Phaser
  texture has no CSS colour context to inherit — it would fall back to black and vanish on
  the black map — so `iconDataUri` bakes the HUD white straight into the markup (per the
  white/black HUD rule) and hands Phaser a **base64** data URI. It must be base64, not
  percent-encoded: Phaser's SVG loader `atob`s the payload, and a percent-encoded URI makes
  `atob` throw so the loader stalls and never fires `create`. Icon markup must be pure ASCII
  (`btoa` throws otherwise) and must actually contain a `currentColor` to replace — both are
  treated as build-time bugs and throw, never degrade to an invisible/placeholder icon.
- **Tunable numbers live in `src/game/config.ts`**, in CSS pixels where they describe
  on-screen sizes. Logic lives in the layers; the numbers you might want to nudge live in
  config. Follow this split for new features.
- **Device pixels:** the canvas backing store is sized at `cssPixels * DPR` and scaled
  back via Phaser's `zoom` config, so all in-game coordinates are device pixels. Convert
  CSS-pixel config values with `DPR` (usually via `screenPxToWorld`). Every Phaser `Text`
  object created for a marker label (AirportLayer, CityLayer, RadarLayer) sets
  `resolution: DPR` in its style so the text rasterizes at device resolution and stays
  crisp on HiDPI displays — a standing convention, not a per-layer choice.

## Camera bounds are locked — never change them on your own

The zoom limits (`ZOOM.min` / `ZOOM.max`) and the camera-movement bounds
(`CAMERA_CENTER_BOUNDS`) in `src/game/config.ts` are **deliberately tuned game
settings**. Do **not** change these values, and do not alter the clamp logic in
`CameraController` that enforces them, unless the user explicitly asks you to in that
request. They are not free to "improve", refactor away, or adjust as a side effect of
another change. If a task seems to require different zoom/pan limits, stop and ask the
user first rather than editing them.

Note: `CAMERA_CENTER_BOUNDS` was widened from the original Denmark-only box to the full
radar-coverage footprint on 2026-07-08 **at the user's explicit request**, so the player
can pan out to see every radar's range. The opening framing is pinned separately by
`CAMERA_INITIAL_CENTER` (central Denmark) and passed to `CameraController` as
`initialCenter`, so the roam box and the start view are independent — widening the box does
not move where the map opens. The "locked" rule still stands for any *future* change:
don't touch either constant without a fresh explicit request.

The bounds are enforced by a **manual centre-clamp** (`CameraController.clampCamera`), not
Phaser's `camera.setBounds`. `setBounds` locks and re-centres the camera whenever the visible
area is larger than the bounds — which is the normal case here (a small country in a large
viewport) — and would forbid panning and fight the zoom-to-cursor anchor. The clamp instead
confines the camera *centre* (deriving `scroll = centre − size/2`), so the pannable region
stays the same at every zoom level rather than shrinking as you zoom in.
